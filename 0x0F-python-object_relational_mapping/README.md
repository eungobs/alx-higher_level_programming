0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

This project bridges the realms of Databases and Python! It involves two significant parts:

Using the MySQLdb module to connect to a MySQL database and execute SQL queries.
Leveraging SQLAlchemy, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM), to abstract away SQL queries, focusing on utilizing Python code.
ORMs abstract storage from usage, enabling more focus on manipulating objects rather than concerning oneself with storage details. This ensures code flexibility when switching between storage types without rewriting the entire project.
